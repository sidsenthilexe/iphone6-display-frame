# iphone6-display-frame
Creating a display frame using an iPhone 6 for the 10th anniversary of its release.

## Synopsis: Creating a display piece, similar to the ones from GRID, using an old iPhone 6.

### Completed:

1. Diassembly: fairly straightforward, just using a precision screwdriver. Some parts needed to be pried apart with a spudger.
2. Creating template: Laid out components on a piece of tabloid sized paper, scanned it using a phone. Imported the image to GIMP to add text (using SF Pro Display font).

### Next Steps:

1. Find a suitable adhesive to be used (likely double sided tape)
2. Print template
3. Assemble
